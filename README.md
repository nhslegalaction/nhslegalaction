In the last 24 hours I am receiving bizarre psychotic abuse‚Ä¶

From several male patients‚Ä¶

Alluding to ‚Äúhomosexuality‚Äù

‚Äúhygiene problems‚Äù

‚Äúpaedophilia‚Äù

All of the abuse started towards me within a short space on time.

I didn‚Äôt provoke any of this.

It looks like I need to stay in my room‚Ä¶

Simply to avoid the bizarre psychotic abuse.

I have recently realised that there is a lot of pure comedy gold about being locked inside this NHS ‚Äúhotel‚Äù which is run by a group of mad psychopaths who claim to have Mickey Mouse degrees in psychiatry.

I think there must be some comedy people at the BBC or ITV who would be able to start a brilliant comedy series based on my observations since being locked in here.

My favourite so far, has been my lesson on how to flush a toilet by the support staff. I tried to explain that the semiconductor digital switches continuously malfunction. 

But the support staff did not realise that Physics graduates from the University of London already know how to flush a toilet!!

Meanwhile I plan to do my abs workout today...

Despite being continuously kicked off the NHS free WiFi... I managed to pair my phone and download the first Karparthy lesson about neural networks...

I have plenty of caffeine and I enjoy Artificial Intelligence.

I am doing an experiment to see if I can learn AI whilst I am being forcibly injected with pharma meds in my backside against my will...

By idiots who would fail GCSE Mathematics let alone have any idea what Artificial Intelligence is, or how it even works...

## Monday 25th March 2024

My Apple laptop which is still under AppleCare until March 2025 is conveniently having a lot of serious problems in the last few days. I am having bizarre problems with git revision control which I use to converse with Github. 

The ffmpeg tool appears to be transcoding random audio files instead of what I am trying to actually convert and upload. The ffmpeg tool is now generating media files which are corrupted in terms of rendered totally useless and cannot be played back. 

I had to upload a wav file because it is no longer possible to convert to opus. I cannot record any audio on Audacity because the ssd drive keeps having several gigabytes of space being filled up in minutes when nothing is actually happening on my laptop.

On a Linux device, these bizarre behaviours would immediately be identified as some kind of malware infection.

Apple is proprietary so you cannot really know how to protect yourself since you do not have any control or access to the source code.

I intend to switch to a Spanish-built KDE Linux Slimbook laptop as soon as I am able to.

I am being forced to keep a written account of events because I have no electronic devices left which work correctly; iPhone, iPad, Apple laptop.
