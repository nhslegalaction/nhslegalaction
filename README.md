Despite being continuously kicked off the NHS free WiFi... I managed to pair my phone and download the first Karparthy lesson about neural networks...

I have plenty of caffeine and I enjoy Artificial Intelligence.

I am doing an experiment to see if I can learn AI whilst I am being forcibly injected with pharma meds in my backside against my will...

By idiots who would fail GCSE Mathematics let alone have any idea what Artificial Intelligence is, or how it even works...

My Apple laptop which is still under AppleCare until March 2025 is conveniently having a lot of serious problems in the last few days. I am having bizarre problems with git revision control which I use to converse with Github. 

The ffmpeg tool appears to be transcoding random audio files instead of what I am trying to actually convert and upload. The ffmpeg tool is now generating media files which are corrupted in terms of rendered totally useless and cannot be played back. 

I had to upload a wav file because it is no longer possible to convert to opus. I cannot record any audio on Audacity because the ssd drive keeps having several gigabytes of space being filled up in minutes when nothing is actually happening on my laptop.

On a Linux device, these bizarre behaviours would immediately be identified as some kind of malware infection.

Apple is proprietary so you cannot really know how to protect yourself since you do not have any control or access to the source code.

I intend to switch to a Spanish-built KDE Linux Slimbook laptop as soon as I am able to.

I am being forced to keep a written account of events because I have no electronic devices left which work correctly; iPhone, iPad, Apple laptop.
